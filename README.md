Synopsis:\
I had an idea for integrating a shrinking mechanic into a driving game that would let you navigate an open world either as a full-size racer or shink and be able to weave in and out between and underneath traffic. Then I added a bit of oomph by increasing the impact a car would take from below if the player increased in size while underneath them. It would send the car flying to humous results.

Purpose:
* Figure out the best way to implement an easy to toggle shinking / growing mechanic
* Implement a top down in game mini map
* Fill a small city block with moving cars
* Try out different UI methods to visually demonstrate cars ability and location

Software and Equipment:
* Unity Engine - C#
* Blender
